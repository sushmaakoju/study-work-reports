## Studying about Logic and Philosophy : Sushma Akoju, she/her/hers

Research interests: first order and higher order logic & reasoning in language, theory of natural logic, morality in AI and moral reasoning in language, normative phenomenology, category theory, coalgebra, legal policies, criminal psychology and many more topics. It seems nice to have various interests in topics and subjects as it helps to keep the perpective. Learning is the only constant.

### Sources of study and "Why study logic?"

- Since my childhood, I had a chance to read books on Philosophy, Socratic style of questioning, Socrates's philosophy 
  and various types of philosophies. I got a chance to read on logic in philosophy and logic in language.
- Had a chance to read on moral reasoning and ethical norms under philosophy from my dad's library and discuss with my dad.
- In addition to this, had a chance to read more books on art, art history, western philosophy since My dad is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/painter">painter</a> and an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artist">artist</a> (artist: because he studies literature and writes poetry, also a journalist). I learnt about legal policies and law from my mom (also a journalist and writer aside from being an Accountant, retired).
- Both of my paternal grand parents were ardent readers until they left me and my family with more memories. My maternal grand mom did her Bachelors and Masters in Music back in 1930s, which was supposed to a dreadful experience for women to go to even colleges/universities or even study. My paternal grand mom is an ardent reader of mythologies and was critic of the mythologies.
- Also read books on Forms of legal policies influenced from philosophies (such as Plato's).
- My grandparents were also into reading mytholgies, music history.
- Researchers I worked with, such as Prof. Tom Mitchell, Abulhair Saparov, Prof. Justine Cassell, Prof. James H. Martin, 
  Prof. Brian Zaharatos, Prof. Mihai Surdeanu - also shared interesting subjects, materials and topics to learn and opportunities to discuss.

### Some of the good quotes from Nietzsche, Erich Fromm, Suzanne Collins, Marie Curie

```
Without music, life would be a mistake. ― Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols
``` 

```
There are no facts, only interpretations. ― Friedrich Nietzsche
``` 

```
The task of the moral philosopher-thinker is to support and strengthen the voice of human conscience, to recognize 
what is good or what is bad for people, whether they are good or bad for society in a period of evolution. 
May be a "voice crying in the wilderness", but only if that voice remains lively and uncompromising, 
it is possible to transform the desert into fertile land. — Erich Fromm (An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics)
``` 

``` 
Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.
― Marie Curie
``` 

**Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3 2010):**
``` "Is that why you hate me?" I ask.
"Partly," She admits. "Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you're a little hard to swallow. 
With your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn't an act, which makes you more unbearable. 
Please feel free to take this personally. — Suzanne Collins (Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3))
``` 

**You've got mail (1998)**

<a href="https://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Youve_got_mail.html">You've got mail (movie script)</a>
adapted from <a href="https://www.playscripts.com/sample/1640">Parfumerie (Adapted English version)</a>. The latest version of this play, made into a movie was based on The Shop Around The corner and this interesting quote:

```
Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead a small life.  Well, not small, but circumscribed. And sometimes I wonder,
do I do it because I like it, or because I haven't been brave? So much of what I see reminds me of something 
I read in a book, when shouldn't it be the other way around? I don't really want an answer. I just want to send 
this cosmic question out into the void. So goodnight, dear void. 
- Kathleen Kelly, from You've got mail by Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron
``` 

```
Is what you think what you see and hear? or is what you see and hear what you think? and why?
- philosophically anonymous.
```
