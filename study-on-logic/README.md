### Some of the good quotes from Nietzsche, Erich Fromm, Suzanne Collins, Marie Curie

"Without music, life would be a mistake." ― Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols

"There are no facts, only interpretations." ― Friedrich Nietzsche

"The task of the moral philosopher-thinker is to support and strengthen the voice of human conscience, to recognize what is good or what is bad for people, whether they are good or bad for society in a period of evolution. May be a "voice crying in the wilderness", but only if that voice remains lively and uncompromising, it is possible to transform the desert into fertile land."
— Erich Fromm (An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics)

**Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3):**
"Is that why you hate me?" I ask.
"Partly," She admits. "Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you're a little hard to swallow. With your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn't an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please feel free to take this personally." — Suzanne Collins (Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3))

“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”
― Marie Curie
