# study-work-reports: Sushma Akoju, she/her/hers

This repository was added since I felt compelled to show work experiences and course projects worked on since many people ask me about proof of works, study and research. I do not prefer to display or promote skills. I generally like learning. These works demonstrate my journey, my contributions, learning summaries. If any of works included other member's contributions, I have explicitly mentioned the same. This record also refuses and condemns any false claims of ownership of any of these works.

**For employment based records, respective Human Resource contacts were provided.**

## Research Interests
Formal verification of AI systems. Interests: first-order and higher-order logic & reasoning in language, automated reasoning, constructive and substructural logic, automata, mathematical consciousness, morality in AI and moral reasoning in language, normative phenomenology, category theory, coalgebra.

#### Views (my own):

As per <a href="https://amcs-community.org/">Mathematical Consciousness Science</a>, it seems more reasonable to understand and look for mathematical aspects of logic under consciousness such as - automated reasoning, satisfiability, tractable logic contribute towards, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09442">Consciousness and Automated Reasoning
</a>. Whether learning to reason from data or by formally using logical reasoning algorithms to verify logical reasoning capabilities - is an interesting topic, as per <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/21498">Knowledge and Logical Reasoning in the Era of Data-driven Learning </a>. Therefore <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/"> Pause-giant-ai-experiments</a> until a formal verification and assessment of existing AI systems for the presence of Consciousness exists- seems reasonable. Putting it all together, open questions that seem interesting: 
- what does it really mean to suggest emergent capabilities under consciousness?? 
- what is the intersection of emergent capabilities, logical reasoning, and consciousness?? 
- what are the representational, cognitive aspects that define the "correct" working of the LLMs as AI systems?

#### Note

- I am interested in formal verification of AI systems and first-order logic. Interests: first-order and higher-order logic & reasoning in language, automated reasoning, constructive and substructural logic, automata, mathematical consciousness, morality in AI and moral reasoning in language, normative phenomenology, category theory, coalgebra.

- I consider PhD is no different than a Research Programmer job except that one gets to learn something one is interested in.

- Some insights for safety awareness for women in academia about misogyny and other things: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/sa-sh-awareness"> speaks for itself about how safe campuses are for women.</a>. My pronouns: she/her/hers.

**My research goal as mentioned here is changed since after the advent of ChaGPT and after which is not yet updated since July 2023:** <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/study-work-reports/blob/main/university-of-arizona/sushma-akoju-Natural%20Language%20to%20First%20Order%20Logic.pdf"> Natural Language to First Order Logic before ChatGPT</a>. 

Since there is more attention as well as sudden shift in research focus recently towards logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, I would prefer my new+updated research goals to remain confidential and private for sometime. Hence updated goals were deferred. (Coming up soon!!).

I have a statement of purpose that was shared with limited number of people which is protected under copyrights.

**(Updated Dec 20th 2023)**: However the Natural Language (NL) to First Order Logic (FOL) Translation problem seems to be most likely but partially solved (by LLMs with emergent capabilities). This is added after reading the following works that show evidences of FOL in GPT3 from ICLR 2023 and NL to FOL translations in GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and StarCoder+ EMNLP 2023 respectively:
