#### Views (my own):

As per <a href="https://amcs-community.org/">Mathematical Consciousness Science</a>, it seems more reasonable to understand and look for mathematical aspects of consciousness where logic - automated reasoning, satisfiability, tractable logic contribute towards: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09442">Consciousness and Automated Reasoning
</a>. Whether learning to reason from data or formally using logical reasoning algorithms - is an interesting question, as per <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/21498">Knowledge and Logical Reasoning in the Era of Data-driven Learning </a>. Therefore <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/"> Pause-giant-ai-experiments</a> until a formal verification and assessment of existing AI systems for the presence of Consciousness exists- seems reasonable. Putting it all together, open questions that seem interesting: 
- what does it really mean to suggest emergent capabilities under consciousness?? 
- what is the intersection of emergent capabilities, logical reasoning, and consciousness?? 
- what are the representational, cognitive aspects that define the "correct" working of the LLMs as AI systems?

#### Note

- I received maximum criticism for signing Pause Giant AI from traditional/backward-thinking researchers. I did experience strong misogyny around. I have been sent emails that I am the savior of AI etc. I am not. If anyone is reaching out to you about me and saying negative things about my stand, I am not responsible for the same. Also if you hear any negative "career" damaging remarks from anyone or even subtle gaslighting remarks about me or use of my photos/videos (taken without my consent) or any of my modified photos/videos from Stable Diffusion and other AI tools - just like criminal psychology suggests these are red flags, I am not responsible. The reason for signing Pause AI is: <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/study-work-reports/tree/main/university-of-colorado-boulder">A perspective of not wanting to work in the industry and why.</a>.

- No <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/character_assassination">character assassination for harassment </a>! <a href="https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/arizona-defamation-law">Law</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defamation#:~:text=To%20prove%20prima%20facie%20defamation,entity%20who%20is%20the%20subject">defamation includes fault amounting to at least negligence under extenuating situation.</a>

- I am interested in formal verification of AI systems and first-order logic. Interests: first-order and higher-order logic & reasoning in language, automated reasoning, constructive and substructural logic, automata, mathematical consciousness, morality in AI and moral reasoning in language, normative phenomenology, category theory, coalgebra. 

- Some insights for safety awareness for women in academia about misogyny and other things: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/sa-sh-awareness">Any action that is targeted to cause pain/harm to another human must be condemned. Because women in academia are equally "women".</a>. My pronouns: she/her/hers.

My research goal is same as mentioned here: <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/study-work-reports/blob/main/university-of-arizona/sushma-akoju-Natural%20Language%20to%20First%20Order%20Logic.pdf">Natural Language to First Order Logic</a>
