#### Views (my own):

As per <a href="https://amcs-community.org/">Mathematical Consciousness Science</a>, it seems more reasonable to understand and look for mathematical aspects of consciousness where logic - automated reasoning, satisfiability, tractable logic contribute towards: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09442">Consciousness and Automated Reasoning
</a>. Whether learning to reason from data or formally using logical reasoning algorithms - is an interesting question, as per <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/21498">Knowledge and Logical Reasoning in the Era of Data-driven Learning </a>. Therefore <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/"> Pause-giant-ai-experiments</a> until a formal verification and assessment of existing AI systems for presence of Consciousness exists- seems reasonable. Putting it all together, open questions that seem interesting: 
- what does it really mean to suggest emergent capabilities under consciousness?? 
- what is the intersection of emergent capabilities, logical reasoning, and consciousness?? 
- what are the representational, cognitive aspects that define "correct" working of the LLMs as AI systems?
