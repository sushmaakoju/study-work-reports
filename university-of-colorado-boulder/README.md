Masters in Data Science:

**Not everyone likes to give up the comfort of an well earning job over to study and do research. If a research interest to help a good cause arises, what can ever go wrong with learning and studying?**

I explored various forms of explainability and interpretability towards complex, black-box-style deep Learning models.
This is because, a lot of students and people, were in a deep-learning-rush and looking at the types of millions of jobs just so focussed on Deep Learning and over-estimated use of such models. I thought learning and finding "interpretability" and "explainability" in the deep learning models was not this hard. It was neverthless surprising that a majority of industry jobs race towards deep learning models without actually even being worried about interpetability and explainability or even backward verification of results in downstream or upstream tasks for production release in the industry. We spend so much time writing design testing, prototype-testing, unit testing, functional testing, regression testing, usability and many more types of testing that I am not really familiar about. Something must have been really promising to use Deep Learning models, even without having rough, "approximated" clarity or accounting from the output end (results) all the way back to the input data in a complex network. There were both advantages and disadvantages. I am certainly not an expert but I wanted to find out. I explored trying to address the same using logic and various of following directions.

1. First by comparing traditional statistical methods and their simplicity, explainability with that of unexplainable deep learning models.
2. Second by exploring StrategyQA, EntailmentBank from Allen AI Institute's datasets and research papers, then by studying Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and Logical Neural Networks.
3. Third, by understanding state-of-the-art Natural Language research towards Logic and Reasoning.
4. Fourth, by exploring visual explainability of Deep Learning models.
5. Also explored philosophical and ethical requirements for the industry-driven tasks using Deep Learning models and AI. There are pros and cons.
6. Need for generalization and abstractions versus domain-specific, task-oriented AI pipelines in Data Science and Data Analysis.

## Courses and Course Projects: Towards Logic and Reasoning in Language

### Data Mining, Prof. Di Wu, Fall 2021

Here the challenge was we were working on a project that is vastly unfamiliar to most of the students. So we had to start ground up which was also helpful for self-learning purposes.

### Big Data Architecture, ATLS 5241: Gregory Greenstreet, Brian Newsom, Spring 2022

This project is for demonstrating the concepts from Big Data Arhcitecture class: Google Cloud and industry best practices for deplyoment. This was part of the Big Data Architecture course during my Masters in Data Science at University of Colorado Boulder, Spring 2022. The Big Data Architecture course only focusses on deployment, cloud environments and developing apis along with industry best practices.

#### research goal
It was an exploratory self-study to learn about Theorem Provers and Turing Completeness. - Self-learning goal.

## Independent Study, Prof. Henry Lovejoy : study and design of NER & Text extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes

I worked on an Independent Study supervised by Prof. Henry Lovejoy for the Digital Slavery Research Lab, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It was towards study and design of Named Entity Recognition from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents. The goal was to analyze and emancipate both people and present-impressions of the past: <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/dsrl/collaborators"></a>.

- The challenge here was Named Entity Recognition needs to run over the text extracted from 19th century English language text corpus. Performance over BERT under zero-shot settings was poor for 80% of vocabulary. So we used <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/macberth-eval">MacBERTh</a> model.
